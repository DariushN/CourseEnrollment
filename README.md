# Course Enrollment
This program checks for the validity of a course enrollment by taking into consideration the student's current and past courses completed, all through three main steps. First, it initializes its course library by reading an input file, and taking all the relevant information such as the course code, the number of credits given, and its prerequisites, and getting rid of the duplicate entries. It then proceeds to read a Student Request input file, which holds the courses completed and requested by the student. Finally, the third step would be to determine if the enrolment into the wanted courses are possible by analyzing the library and the portfolio of the student, as taken in the previous steps.
## How to use
1. Fill the Syllabus.txt file with the desired courses to be stored in the library and its required infos (follow the template)
2. Create some text files with the requested courses and the ones completed, by following the syntax of the Request?.txt files given
3. Run the program and enter the name of text file (as created in step 2) that the user wishes to analyze
4. If the user wishes to search a course from the library and get all the information about it, he/she can do so by entering its code when prompted (right after step 3)
